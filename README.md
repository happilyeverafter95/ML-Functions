# Machine Learning Functions in Python

Recreating machine learning functions in Python from scratch. 

The purpose of these exercises is to become more familiar with machine learning algorithms and the maths behind them. 

**Contents**

*Logistic Regression*: Iteratively updated through Fischer's Scoring method until weights converge. 

*Single Layer Feed Forward Neural Network*: Iteratively updated through back propagation until weights converge (also keeps track of epochs). 

*Support Vector Machine*: Hard margin and soft margin (did not penalize slackness) SVM.
